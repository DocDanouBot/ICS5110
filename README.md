## Usage
To pull this repos and bring it locally, go into the folder of your choise and do a
> `git clone git@github.com:DocDanouBot/ICS5110.git`

regular git-usage rules apply. I think as you are all invited, you can add your own ssh-key within our own accounts. I suppose that this is independent from this repos.

## Deliverables

The final ***Assignment paper*** we use the master-template from the uni website. The optimized and prepared version can be found here:

But of course, the one we optimise and work with can be found here in this repos under
* [/data](https://github.com/DocDanouBot/ICS5110/tree/master/data)

I'd propose to store eachs code in their own directory. And use the other sub-directories below.
