## Usage
To pull this repos and bring it locally, go into the folder of your choise and do a
> `git clone git@github.com:DocDanouBot/ICS5110.git`

regular git-usage rules apply. I think as you are all invited, you can add your own ssh-key within our own accounts. I suppose that this is independent from this repos.

## Deliverables

The ***Journal document*** file can be found here:
* https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OYasAGGiOdcpnwj0BQFHTR_HgXUwIvYkn92UqCV6fMk/edit?tab=t.0

The final ***Assignment paper*** we use the master-template from the uni website. The optimized and prepared version can be found here:
* https://www.overleaf.com/project/671f5602b8967f23a9d7681e [**(1)**](https://www.overleaf.com/project/671f5602b8967f23a9d7681e) from Danou
* https://www.overleaf.com/project/671b2c1521d98e279ab53de5 [**(2)**](https://www.overleaf.com/project/671b2c1521d98e279ab53de5) from Owen

Note: These are two different version from apparently different master-template sources. They are both looking good, both from the Uni-website and in LaTeX-format. I do not know which one is the better one, or -better said- the expected one. We need to make a decision on this.

The ***Plagasim form***, each one has to fill it out and sign it seperatly

The **Journal document file** (see above) to fill in our steps can be found here:

The **original dataset** was sourced and forked from here

But of course, the one we optimise and work with can be found here in this repos under
* [/data](https://github.com/DocDanouBot/ICS5110/tree/master/data)

I'd propose to store eachs code in their own directory. And use the other sub-directories below.
